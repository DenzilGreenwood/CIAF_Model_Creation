# CIAF Codebase Cleanup Documentation

This folder contains items that have been identified for deletion or cleanup from the CIAF codebase. Each section explains what was moved, why it should be deleted, and the impact of removal.

## Overview of Cleanup Actions

The cleanup process focuses on removing:
1. **Development artifacts** (cache files, temporary build files)
2. **IDE-specific configurations** (VS Code settings, workspace files)
3. **Build artifacts** (LaTeX auxiliary files, compiled outputs)
4. **Development tools** (pre-commit hooks, development dependencies)
5. **Obsolete CI/CD configurations** (GitHub Actions)

## Items Moved to DELETE_CLEANUP Folder

### 1. Cache and Temporary Files
**Location:** `DELETE_CLEANUP/cache_files/`
**Items:**
- `.mypy_cache/` - MyPy type checker cache
- `.pytest_cache/` - PyTest cache directory
- `examples/__pycache__/` - Python bytecode cache
- Various `.aux`, `.fdb_latexmk`, `.fls`, `.log`, `.synctex.gz` files from LaTeX builds

**Reason for Deletion:**
- These are automatically generated files that serve no purpose in the repository
- They can be regenerated when needed during development
- They bloat the repository size unnecessarily
- They can cause conflicts when multiple developers work on the project

**Impact:** None - these files are automatically regenerated when needed

### 2. IDE Configuration Files
**Location:** `DELETE_CLEANUP/ide_config/`
**Items:**
- `.vscode/` directory (VS Code workspace settings)
- `CIAF_Workspace.code-workspace` - VS Code workspace file
- `VSCODE_SETUP_README.md` - VS Code setup documentation
- `setup_vscode.py` - VS Code configuration script

**Reason for Deletion:**
- IDE configurations are user-specific and shouldn't be version controlled
- Different developers may prefer different IDE settings
- These files can interfere with individual developer preferences
- They're not essential for the core CIAF functionality

**Impact:** Developers will need to configure their own IDE settings

### 3. Development Tools and Configuration
**Location:** `DELETE_CLEANUP/dev_tools/`
**Items:**
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks configuration
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies
- `ai-agent-setup.ps1` - PowerShell setup script
- `.ciaf-agent-config.yaml` - Agent configuration

**Reason for Deletion:**
- These are development-time tools not needed for production use
- Pre-commit hooks can be configured individually by developers
- Development dependencies are separate from core runtime requirements
- Setup scripts may be outdated or environment-specific

**Impact:** Developers will need to set up their own development environment

### 4. LaTeX Build Artifacts
**Location:** `DELETE_CLEANUP/latex_artifacts/`
**Items:**
- All `.aux`, `.fdb_latexmk`, `.fls`, `.log`, `.synctex.gz`, `.toc` files
- Generated PDF files (can be rebuilt from source)

**Reason for Deletion:**
- These are build artifacts that can be regenerated from source `.tex` files
- They bloat the repository with binary/generated content
- Different LaTeX environments may produce different artifacts
- Only source `.tex` files should be version controlled

**Impact:** Users will need to compile LaTeX documents to generate PDFs

### 5. Analysis and Validation Files
**Location:** `DELETE_CLEANUP/analysis_files/`
**Items:**
- `CIAF_PAPER_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Development documentation
- `CODEBASE_VALIDATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis documentation
- `verification_report.json` - Automated verification output
- `ciaf_roi_analysis_data.json` - ROI analysis data
- `CITATION_ANCHOR_SUMMARY.md` - Citation analysis

**Reason for Deletion:**
- These are development-time analysis documents
- They represent work-in-progress rather than final deliverables
- The information may be outdated or superseded by final documentation
- They're not needed for end users of the framework

**Impact:** Loss of development history, but final documentation remains

### 6. Test and Demo Files
**Location:** `DELETE_CLEANUP/test_demo_files/`
**Items:**
- `test_citations.py` - Test script for citations
- Various demo files in `examples/` that are for development testing only

**Reason for Deletion:**
- These are development test files, not production examples
- Proper examples should be in the main examples directory
- Test files should be in a dedicated test directory structure

**Impact:** Developers will need to create new test files if needed

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Deletion (Safe)
These items can be deleted immediately with no impact:
- All cache directories (`.mypy_cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`)
- All LaTeX build artifacts (`.aux`, `.log`, etc.)
- Python cache files (`__pycache__/`)

### Consider for Deletion (Review Required)
These items should be reviewed before deletion:
- IDE configuration files (may want to keep as templates)
- Development documentation (may contain useful historical information)
- Demo files (ensure essential examples are preserved elsewhere)

### Keep but Relocate
These items might be useful but should be organized differently:
- Essential examples should remain in `examples/` but be properly documented
- Core scripts should remain in `scripts/` but be reviewed for necessity
- Development dependencies could be consolidated or documented

## Post-Cleanup Repository Structure

After cleanup, the repository should contain only:
- **Core CIAF source code** (`ciaf/` directory)
- **Essential documentation** (README, LICENSE, NOTICE)
- **Production examples** (curated examples directory)
- **Essential scripts** (core validation and utility scripts)
- **Requirement files** (runtime dependencies only)
- **Documentation** (Docs/, Whitepapers/)

## Verification Steps

After cleanup:
1. Ensure core CIAF functionality still works
2. Verify examples run correctly
3. Check that documentation builds properly
4. Confirm essential scripts execute without errors
5. Test that the package can be installed and imported

## Notes

- This cleanup focuses on reducing repository bloat while preserving functionality
- Deleted items can be recovered from git history if needed
- Consider adding appropriate entries to `.gitignore` to prevent future accumulation
- Review and update the main README.md to reflect the cleaned-up structure
