# Cache Files Moved to DELETE_CLEANUP

This directory contains cache and temporary files that were automatically generated during development and should be deleted.

## Files Moved Here:

### `.mypy_cache/`
- **Purpose:** MyPy type checker cache
- **Safe to delete:** Yes
- **Regenerated:** Automatically when running MyPy

### `.pytest_cache/`
- **Purpose:** PyTest test runner cache
- **Safe to delete:** Yes  
- **Regenerated:** Automatically when running PyTest

### `__pycache__/` (from examples/)
- **Purpose:** Python bytecode cache
- **Safe to delete:** Yes
- **Regenerated:** Automatically when importing Python modules

## Cleanup Instructions:

1. **Review contents** to ensure no important files were accidentally moved
2. **Delete entire folder** - these files serve no purpose in the repository
3. **Add to .gitignore** to prevent future accumulation:
   ```
   __pycache__/
   *.pyc
   .mypy_cache/
   .pytest_cache/
   ```

## Impact of Deletion:
- **None** - these files are automatically regenerated as needed
- Improves repository cleanliness and reduces size
- Prevents cache conflicts between different environments
