# LaTeX Build Artifacts Moved to DELETE_CLEANUP

This directory contains LaTeX compilation artifacts that were removed from the main repository.

## Files Moved Here:

### `.aux` files
- **Purpose:** LaTeX auxiliary files containing cross-references, citations, etc.
- **Safe to delete:** Yes - regenerated during LaTeX compilation
- **Examples:** `ciaf_styles_example.aux`, `LCM_Technical_Disclosure_with_styles.aux`

### `.fdb_latexmk` files
- **Purpose:** Latexmk database files tracking file dependencies
- **Safe to delete:** Yes - regenerated by latexmk
- **Impact:** None - latexmk will recreate as needed

### `.fls` files
- **Purpose:** File list files created by LaTeX during compilation
- **Safe to delete:** Yes - regenerated during compilation
- **Impact:** None - automatically recreated

### `.log` files
- **Purpose:** LaTeX compilation log files showing warnings, errors, etc.
- **Safe to delete:** Yes - regenerated each compilation
- **Impact:** Loss of compilation history, but new logs created on rebuild

### `.synctex.gz` files
- **Purpose:** SyncTeX files for PDF-source synchronization in editors
- **Safe to delete:** Yes - regenerated if SyncTeX is enabled
- **Impact:** Loss of PDF-source linking until regenerated

### `.toc` files
- **Purpose:** Table of contents files for LaTeX documents
- **Safe to delete:** Yes - regenerated during compilation
- **Impact:** None - automatically recreated

## LaTeX Compilation Workflow:

To regenerate these files and compile LaTeX documents:

### Using pdflatex:
```bash
cd examples/
pdflatex ciaf_styles_example.tex
pdflatex LCM_Technical_Disclosure_with_styles.tex
```

### Using latexmk (recommended):
```bash
cd examples/
latexmk -pdf ciaf_styles_example.tex
latexmk -pdf LCM_Technical_Disclosure_with_styles.tex
```

### Clean up after compilation:
```bash
latexmk -c  # Clean auxiliary files
latexmk -C  # Clean all generated files including PDFs
```

## Why Remove LaTeX Artifacts?

1. **Binary Files:** These are binary/generated files that don't belong in version control
2. **Environment Specific:** Different LaTeX installations may produce different artifacts
3. **Size:** These files can be large and bloat the repository
4. **Regeneratable:** All files can be recreated from source `.tex` files
5. **Conflicts:** Binary files can cause merge conflicts

## Best Practices:

### .gitignore entries to add:
```
# LaTeX build artifacts
*.aux
*.fdb_latexmk
*.fls
*.log
*.synctex.gz
*.toc
*.out
*.bbl
*.blg
*.idx
*.ind
*.ilg
*.nav
*.snm
*.vrb
```

### Keep in repository:
- Source `.tex` files
- Style files (`.sty`)
- Bibliography files (`.bib`)
- Image files used in documents

### Don't keep in repository:
- Any generated/compiled files
- PDF outputs (unless they're final releases)
- Build artifacts and logs

## PDF Generation:

If you need the PDF files, compile them from source:
1. Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (TeX Live, MiKTeX, etc.)
2. Navigate to the examples directory
3. Run the compilation commands above
4. Generated PDFs will be created in the same directory
