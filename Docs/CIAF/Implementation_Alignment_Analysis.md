## Academic Integrity Approach

### Disclosure Strategy

The paper now includes comprehensive implementation notes that:

1. **Distinguish Categories**: Clearly separate exact matches, pedagogical examples, and architectural patterns
2. **Provide Mapping**: Show exact relationships between paper examples and production code
3. **Maintain Educational Value**: Keep simplified examples for concept communication
4. **Ensure Transparency**: Full disclosure of the relationship between educational and production code

### Standards Compliance

This approach follows standard academic practices where:
- **Architectural Fidelity**: Core patterns accurately represent production implementation
- **Pedagogical Clarity**: Examples prioritize understanding over implementation complexity
