- **WORM Semantics**: Write-Once-Read-Many ledger with immutable audit records
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: SHA-256 hashing, PBKDF2 key derivation, HMAC authentication

#### üèõÔ∏è **Regulatory Compliance**
- **Multi-jurisdictional Support**: EU AI Act, US Federal/State laws, Brazil LGPD, China regulations
- **Automated Compliance Tracking**: Real-time monitoring and reporting
- **Human Oversight**: Built-in human-in-the-loop and human-on-the-loop mechanisms
- **Bias Detection**: Algorithmic fairness monitoring and mitigation

#### üè≠ **Industry Adaptability**
- **Sector-specific Implementations**: Banking, Healthcare, Government, Manufacturing, Education, and more
- **Configurable Policies**: Industry-specific compliance policies and frameworks
- **Integration Ready**: APIs and wrappers for major ML frameworks and cloud platforms
