## 0) How to use this guide
This companion explains *why each part of the portfolio matters*, *what decisions it enables*, and *what actions each stakeholder owns*. It maps the universal core to industry guides and frontier domains, using plain language plus links to deeper artifacts.

**Audience**
- **Executives & Board:** investment, risk appetite, milestones, ROI.
- **Legal & Compliance:** regulatory interpretation, assurance, audits.
- **Security & Infrastructure:** controls, evidence, resilience.
- **Data Science & Engineering:** model lifecycle, testing, deployment.
- **Product & Operations:** roadmaps, SLAs, user disclosures, incident playbooks.
- **Sales, Marketing & Comms:** trust claims, certifications, transparency.

---

## 1) Portfolio at a glance (what it *is* and why it’s unique)
- **Universal Core (18k words):** the reusable compliance/gov “spine” for any AI system (policies, RACI, process maps, evidence patterns).
- **21 Industry Guides (340k+ words total):** production-ready procedures tailored to sectoral laws and risks.
- **Frontier Domains:** supply‑chain provenance, foundation models/multi‑agent oversight, sustainability, media/IP, cross‑border harmonization.
- **Outcomes:** measurably lower regulatory risk, faster audits, consistent product disclosures, and cryptographically verifiable evidence (LCM/C2PA).

**What makes CIAF different**
1) **Assurance-by-design:** governance is embedded in SDLC and MLOps (not bolted on).  
2) **Cryptographic provenance:** Lazy Capsule Materialization + WORM evidence + C2PA authenticity.  
3) **Jurisdiction translator:** one control set rendered as EU/US/PRC/BR/SG legal deliverables.  
4) **Scalable audits:** automated checks, attestations, and regulator-ready bundles.

## 2) Stakeholder quick map (who owns what)
| Stakeholder | Primary Decisions | Core Responsibilities | Key Artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Board / Exec** | Risk appetite, budget, go/no-go | Approve policies, receive dashboards, unblock escalations | Policy charter, KRIs, quarterly risk review |
| **Legal / Compliance** | Interpretation, controls, audits | DPIA/FRIA, regulatory mapping, audit readiness | Control library, evidence register, audit packets |
| **Security / Infra** | Architecture & controls | SSDF-aligned SDLC, access/keys, logging, SBOM, DR | Security architecture, incident runbooks |
| **Data Science / Eng** | Model design & validation | Data governance, evals, fairness, traceability | Model cards, test suites, lineage logs |
| **Product / Ops** | Market fit & delivery | User disclosures, human oversight UX, SLAs | System cards, UX copy, playbooks |
| **Sales / Marketing** | Trust claims | Certification use, acceptable claims, RFP responses | Trust one‑pager, certification registry |

**RACI shorthand:** Exec (A), Legal/Compliance (R), Security (R), DS/Eng (R), Product (C), Marketing (C).

## 3) Universal Core — explained for all stakeholders
**What’s inside:** policies, roles, RACI, risk methodology, DPIA/FRIA templates, logging/traceability, change control, incident reporting, vendor governance, model/system cards, evidence capsules.

**Why it matters**  
- Gives a *single source of truth* for controls across jurisdictions.  
- Enables **audit predictability**: same artifacts every time.  
- Makes **engineering work tractable**: controls → tests → evidence.

**What good looks like**  
- Controls linked to code, tests, and logs.  
- Evidence capsules generated per release (immutable, queryable).  
- Dashboards show KRIs: classification accuracy, deadlines met, incident MTTR.

## 4) Tier explanations — what each tier adds
### Tier 1: National Security & Critical Infrastructure
- **Defense & Aerospace:** human‑in‑the‑loop safety, ITAR/EAR export compliance, autonomous oversight.  
- **Telecom:** lawful intercept, spectrum policy, network neutrality in AI‑driven optimization.  
- **Cyber & Digital ID:** Zero Trust, biometric fairness, verifiable identity without bias.

**Stakeholder lens:**  
- Execs: mission risk → national policy exposure.  
- Security: hardening + evidence trails.  
- DS/Eng: adversarial tests, red-team gates.

### Tier 2: Emerging Regulatory Domains
- **HR & Workforce:** NYC LL144 bias audits, EEOC guidance; candidate notices & opt‑outs.  
- **Biotech & Genomics:** FDA GxP + GINA; data sensitivity, validation, and consent.

**Stakeholder lens:**  
- Legal: defensible bias audits + public posting.  
- DS/Eng: dataset representativeness/shift; clinical‑grade validation.

### Tier 3: Established Industries
Banking, Healthcare, Gov, Manufacturing, Education, Retail, Transport, Energy, Insurance, Legal/Prof Svcs.  
**Pattern:** classic sectoral controls + AI overlays (model risk, fairness, transparency).

### Tier 4: Frontier Domains
- **AI Supply Chain:** vendor governance, model provenance, continuous validation.  
- **Foundation Models / Multi‑Agent:** systemic‑risk evals, emergent‑behavior detection, human override.  
- **ESG & Sustainability:** green AI metrics, CSRD/SEC climate reporting automation.  
- **Media/IP:** content authenticity (C2PA), deepfake detection, rights management.  
- **Cross‑Border Harmonization:** configurable regional deployments, data residency.

---

## 5) What each domain delivers (plain‑language outcomes)
- **Risk Mitigation:** fewer violations, faster investigations, lower fines.  
- **Operational Reliability:** reproducible releases, clear fallbacks, human‑override UX.  
- **Market Access:** CE‑marking paths (EU), sector approvals (FDA‑like), NYC audits, Colorado high‑risk duties.  
- **Trust & Growth:** verifiable claims → sales velocity; price premium from assurance.

---

## 6) KPIs & KRIs everyone can read
**Regulatory:** % on‑time filings, # outstanding gaps, days‑to‑audit‑ready.  
**Operational:** % systems with current model/system cards; log completeness; override activations.  
**Fairness & Safety:** drift alerts, bias deltas, adversarial robustness rates.  
**Financial:** penalty exposure, compliance cost %, insured coverage %.  
**Outcome:** time‑to‑market vs. compliance exceptions.

---

## 7) Implementation roadmap — who does what, when
**Phase 1 (Months 1–3):** Core enablement — policies, control library, evidence pipeline, risk register.  
**Phase 2 (Months 4–6):** First industry launch — bias/eval suites, disclosures, human oversight UX, monitoring.  
**Phase 3 (Months 7–12):** Scale — multi‑region deployment, vendor governance, regulator‑ready bundles.  
**Year 2+:** Optimize — certifications (ISO/IEC 42001), continuous audits, thought leadership.

**Work intake model:**  
- Regulation → Requirement → Control → Test → Evidence Capsule → Dashboard/KPI.  
- Owners set in RACI; exceptions require Executive sign‑off with expiry dates.

---

## 8) Evidence & assurance — what auditors will ask for
- **Traceability:** data lineage, model versioning, feature parity, decision logs.  
- **Testing:** bias/fairness, robustness/red‑team, regression, eval on sensitive sub‑groups.  
- **Oversight:** playbooks, thresholds, fail‑safe modes, human‑in‑the‑loop records.  
- **Updates:** change control (PCCP‑style), rollback, communication to users/regulators.  
- **Suppliers:** vendor questionnaires, attestations, right‑to‑audit, indemnities.

---

## 9) Communication pack (for non‑technical audiences)
- **1‑pager:** what we build, why it’s safe, how we prove it (badges, audits, certs).  
- **FAQ:** privacy, fairness, human oversight, recourse.  
- **Status labels:** *Compliant • Conditionally compliant • Under remediation*.  
- **Incident templates:** what happened, what we did, how we prevent recurrence.

---

## 10) Glossary (short, practical)
**AI System Card:** a readable sheet describing purpose, data, limits, metrics, and contacts.  
**Evidence Capsule:** immutable, timestamped package (policies, tests, logs) proving compliance at release time.  
**FRIA/DPIA:** impact assessments for rights/privacy; done before first use, updated on change.  
**GPAI:** general‑purpose AI models; extra duties if systemic risk.  
**Human Oversight:** trained operators can understand, intervene, and override safely.  
**Prohibited Uses:** use‑cases banned by law (e.g., manipulative or discriminatory practices).  
**Systemic Risk Model:** foundation model with capabilities/scale that may create broad harms.

---

## 11) Ready‑to‑run checklists (starter)
- **Classification:** Is the system high‑risk? Is it in a prohibited category?  
- **Data:** Can we prove representativeness, consent, and minimization?  
- **Testing:** Do we have fairness, robustness, and red‑team results on file?  
- **Docs:** Do model/system cards and user disclosures reflect current behavior?  
- **Oversight:** Who is trained? Where are thresholds? What’s the fallback?  
- **Vendors:** Do we have current attestations and SLAs?  
- **Incidents:** Is the runbook tested? Do we meet reporting timelines?

---

## 12) What success looks like (signals to the Board)
- Routine audits passed; zero critical violations.  
- CE‑marking or sector approvals achieved where relevant.  
- Reduced time‑to‑market with fewer exception waivers.  
- Measurable trust (customer renewal, RFP win rate, press sentiment).
