# Brazil AI Governance Framework

This folder contains summaries and analyses of Brazilian laws and regulations relevant to artificial intelligence governance and deployment.

## Overview

Brazil has developed a comprehensive data protection framework through the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), which includes significant provisions for AI systems, particularly around automated decision-making and algorithmic transparency. The country is also developing specific AI governance frameworks through various government initiatives.
