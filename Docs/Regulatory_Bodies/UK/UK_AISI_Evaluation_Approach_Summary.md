- **Capability benchmarking:** Systematic measurement of AI system performance across multiple domains
- **Threshold monitoring:** Identification of capability levels that may trigger enhanced safety requirements

#### 2. Multi-Dimensional Risk Analysis
- **Technical risks:** System reliability, robustness, and security vulnerabilities
- **Societal risks:** Potential impacts on employment, social structures, and democratic processes  
- **Safety risks:** Physical harm potential and critical infrastructure vulnerabilities
- **Misuse risks:** Potential for malicious use or dual-use applications

#### 3. Proportionate Response Framework
- **Graduated interventions:** Responses proportionate to identified risk levels and system capabilities
- **Innovation enablement:** Avoiding unnecessary barriers to beneficial AI development
- **Adaptive governance:** Flexibility to respond to rapidly evolving AI capabilities and risks
- **Evidence-based decisions:** Regulatory responses grounded in rigorous technical evaluation
