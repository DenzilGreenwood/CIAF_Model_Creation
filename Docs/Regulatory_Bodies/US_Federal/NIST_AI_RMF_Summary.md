## AI Risk Management Principles

The framework is built on seven foundational principles that guide trustworthy AI development and deployment:

### 1. Validity and Reliability
AI systems should produce valid, reliable, and repeatable outputs that are appropriate for their intended use.

### 2. Safety
AI systems should not pose unreasonable risks to safety, including physical safety and cybersecurity.

### 3. Fairness and Non-maleficence
AI systems should be designed to avoid harmful bias and discrimination and should not cause undue harm.

### 4. Explainability and Interpretability
AI systems should provide meaningful explanations that are appropriate for the intended audience and use case.

### 5. Privacy Enhancement
AI systems should protect privacy throughout their lifecycle through technical and policy measures.

### 6. Human-AI Configuration
AI systems should be designed to enable appropriate human-AI interaction and augmentation.

### 7. Transparency and Accountability
AI systems should be developed and deployed with appropriate transparency and clear accountability structures.

- **System integration:** Challenges in deploying AI within existing technical infrastructures

### Societal and Ethical Risks
- **Bias and discrimination:** Unfair treatment of individuals or groups
- **Privacy violations:** Inappropriate use or disclosure of personal information
- **Human autonomy:** Inappropriate replacement of human decision-making
- **Social cohesion:** Potential negative impacts on social structures and relationships

### Legal and Regulatory Risks
- **Compliance violations:** Failure to meet applicable legal and regulatory requirements
- **Liability exposure:** Potential legal responsibility for AI system outcomes
- **Intellectual property:** Risks related to training data and model ownership
- **Cross-border considerations:** Challenges in multi-jurisdictional deployments

### Business and Operational Risks
- **Reputational damage:** Negative public perception due to AI system failures
- **Economic impacts:** Financial losses from AI system problems or misuse
- **Supply chain dependencies:** Risks from third-party AI components or services
- **Organizational change:** Challenges in adapting to AI-enabled operations
