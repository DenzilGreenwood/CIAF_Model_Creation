## Regulatory Overview

The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) has adopted comprehensive regulations governing Automated Decision-Making Technology (ADMT) under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). These regulations establish the first state-level consumer privacy rights specifically addressing AI and automated decision-making systems.

### Scope & Purpose

The ADMT regulations aim to enhance consumer transparency and control over automated decision-making processes that significantly affect their lives. The regulations build upon existing CCPA/CPRA privacy rights to create specific protections for AI-driven decisions affecting California consumers.
