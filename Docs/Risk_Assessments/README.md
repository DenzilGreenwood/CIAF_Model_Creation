#### Assessment Scope
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Legal and regulatory requirement violations
- **Financial Impact:** Penalties, fines, and business disruption costs
- **Operational Risk:** Market access restrictions and operational limitations
- **Reputational Impact:** Brand damage and stakeholder confidence loss
