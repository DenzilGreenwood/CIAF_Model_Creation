# CIAF + LCM Research Disclosure Portfolio - Final Version

## Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE WITH FIDELITY CORRECTIONS

**Document**: `CIAF_LCM_Research_Disclosure_Portfolio.pdf` (27 pages)  
**Compilation**: Successful with all corrections implemented  
**Status**: Publication-ready with technical accuracy verified

## Fidelity Corrections Implemented

### 1. Canonical JSON Normative Compliance ✅
- **Fixed**: `ensure_ascii=False` → `ensure_ascii=True` 
- **Added**: NORMATIVE comment clarifying ASCII requirement for canonical JSON
- **Impact**: Ensures compliance with canonical JSON standards

### 2. Storage Reduction Accuracy ✅
- **Fixed**: "85% reduction" → "approximately 85% reduction"
- **Rationale**: Added precision qualifier for scientific accuracy
- **Impact**: Prevents overstated performance claims

### 3. Domain Type Classification Clarification ✅
- **Enhanced**: DomainType explanation as "industry adapter categories"
- **Clarified**: Distinction from canonical CIAF domain enumerations
- **Impact**: Prevents confusion between adapter patterns and core domain types

### 4. Receipt Schema Structure ✅
- **Restructured**: LightweightReceipt to show canonical normative structure first
- **Separated**: Extended application profile as additional context
- **Added**: Clear normative vs. application profile distinction
- **Impact**: Proper documentation hierarchy for implementers

### 5. Normative Requirements ✅
- **Added**: NORMATIVE callouts for canonical JSON requirements
- **Enhanced**: WORM storage invariant documentation
- **Clarified**: MUST/SHOULD requirements for compliance
- **Impact**: Clear guidance for implementers on required vs. optional features
