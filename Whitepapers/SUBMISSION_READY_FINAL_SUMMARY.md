## üéØ Final Polishing Tweaks Applied

### 1. EvidenceStrength Taxonomy Alignment ‚úÖ
**Fixed**: Added complete mapping between canonical and application taxonomies
```python
# Canonical CIAF taxonomy
REAL = "real"           # Direct evidence from actual model execution
SIMULATED = "simulated" # Evidence from verified simulation  
FALLBACK = "fallback"   # Reconstructed evidence with lower confidence

# Application profile mapping
HIGH = "real"      # Maps to REAL - Full cryptographic proof chain
MEDIUM = "simulated"  # Maps to SIMULATED - Selective verification possible
LOW = "fallback"      # Maps to FALLBACK - Basic integrity checking only
```

### 2. Consistency Standards ‚úÖ
**Verified**: All cryptographic references use consistent formatting
- ‚úÖ "SHA-256" (no spaces, proper hyphenation)
- ‚úÖ "Ed25519" (proper casing throughout)

### 3. Normative vs Example Callout ‚úÖ
**Added**: Professional guidance box after Canonical JSON rules
```
NORMATIVE (MUST/SHOULD): Required for CIAF compliance and interoperability
EXAMPLES (MAY): Illustrative implementations that demonstrate best practices
APPLICATION PROFILES: Extended features beyond the canonical specification
```

### 4. License & Citation Footer ‚úÖ
**Added**: Complete copyright, licensing, and citation information
