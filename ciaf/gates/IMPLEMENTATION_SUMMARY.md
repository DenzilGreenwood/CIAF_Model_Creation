CIAF Compliance Gates System Implementation Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive compliance gates system that has been
implemented in the CIAF framework for policy-driven ML lifecycle governance.

## Architecture Overview

The gates system implements the recommended architecture pattern:

1. **Gate Interface (Policy-Driven)**
   - ComplianceGate protocol with evaluate() method
   - GateResult with status âˆˆ {PASS, WARN, FAIL, REVIEW}
   - Policy-driven configuration without model code changes

2. **Orchestrator per Lifecycle Stage**
   - GateOrchestrator with policy-driven gate loading
   - Stage-based execution (DATASET â†’ TRAINING â†’ PRE_DEPLOYMENT â†’ INFERENCE)
   - Cryptographic receipt generation and audit trails
   - Enforcement actions (block, escalate, HITL)

3. **Storage & Proofs**
   - LightweightReceipt generation with Merkle batching
   - Cryptographic signatures and evidence hashing
   - HITL decision receipts with reviewer identity

4. **Policy Switches**
   - Enable/disable gates, configure thresholds
   - No model code changes required
   - Regulatory framework mapping

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Core Interfaces (interfaces.py)
- **GateStatus**: PASS/WARN/FAIL/REVIEW enumeration
- **Stage**: ML lifecycle stages (DATASET/TRAINING/PRE_DEPLOYMENT/INFERENCE)
- **OperationContext**: Comprehensive context with model artifacts, data, metadata
- **GateResult**: Evaluation result with metrics, evidence, and cryptographic proof
- **ComplianceGate**: Protocol interface for all gates
- **PolicyDrivenGate**: Extended protocol for policy configuration

### 2. Orchestration System (orchestrator.py)
- **GateOrchestrator**: Stage-based gate execution with policy enforcement
- **PolicyEnforcer**: Result enforcement with blocking/escalation logic
- Parallel and sequential execution modes
- Fail-fast policy support
- Cryptographic receipt generation
- Error handling and context validation

### 3. Policy Management (policy.py)
- **GatePolicy**: Comprehensive policy configuration
- **PolicyManager**: Policy lifecycle management with versioning
- **StagePolicy**: Stage-specific gate configurations
- **GateConfiguration**: Individual gate settings and thresholds
- JSON/YAML policy file support
- Default policy generation by risk classification

### 4. Cryptographic Receipts (receipts.py)
- **GateReceipt**: Tamper-evident gate evaluation receipts
- **ReviewReceipt**: Human review decision documentation
- **GateReceiptGenerator**: Receipt creation with Merkle tree integration
- **ComplianceAuditTrail**: Long-term audit trail management
- Batch processing with cryptographic roots
- Regulatory compliance reporting

### 5. Specialized Gate Implementations

#### BiasGate (bias_gate.py) - IMPLEMENTED
- Demographic parity evaluation
- Equalized odds assessment  
- Predictive parity validation
- Group representation analysis
- Configurable fairness thresholds
- Stage-specific bias evaluation (dataset/training/inference)
- Corrective action recommendations

#### Additional Gates (To Be Implemented)
- **ExplainabilityGate**: LIME/SHAP coverage and stability validation
- **UncertaintyGate**: MC-dropout/ensemble confidence bounds
- **RobustnessGate**: Adversarial robustness and OOD detection
- **HITLGate**: Human-in-the-loop escalation and review workflows
- **ComplianceMappingGate**: EU AI Act/NIST AI RMF artifact validation

## Gate Catalog Features

### Bias/Fairness Gate
- **Metrics**: Demographic parity, equalized odds, predictive parity
- **Actions**: Retrain, threshold adjustment, data rebalancing
- **Stages**: All stages with stage-appropriate evaluation
- **Thresholds**: Configurable delta limits (default 0.1)

### Policy-Driven Configuration

Gates support runtime configuration without model code changes:

```python
# Example policy configuration
policy_config = {
    "stages": {
        "training": {
            "enabled_gates": ["BiasGate", "UncertaintyGate"],
            "gates": {
                "BiasGate": {
                    "enabled": True,
                    "thresholds": {
                        "demographic_parity_delta": 0.05
                    },
                    "enforcement_action": "block"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Integration Points

### Model Integration (Light Hooks)
- Surface metrics/events from training loops
- Per-epoch confusion matrices by subgroup
- Prediction confidence scores
- Feature importance values

### CIAF Integration (Evaluation Logic)
- All compliance evaluation in CIAF layer
- Pass/fail decisions independent of model
- Portable model deployment
- Regulatory framework mapping

## Regulatory Alignment

The gates system provides comprehensive regulatory compliance:

- **GDPR Article 22**: Automated decision-making safeguards
- **EU AI Act Article 10**: Accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity
- **NIST AI RMF**: MEASURE functions for fairness and reliability
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

## Usage Example

```python
from ciaf.gates import GateOrchestrator, PolicyManager, OperationContext, Stage

# Load policy
policy_manager = PolicyManager()
policy = policy_manager.create_default_policy("ml_project", "high")

# Create orchestrator
orchestrator = GateOrchestrator(policy.to_dict())

# Register gates
from ciaf.gates.implementations import BiasGate
orchestrator.register_gate(BiasGate())

# Create operation context
context = OperationContext(
    stage=Stage.TRAINING,
    operation_id="training_run_001",
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    model_artifacts={"predictions": predictions, "ground_truth": labels},
    custom_context={"sensitive_attributes_data": sensitive_attrs}
)

# Run compliance gates
results = orchestrator.run_stage_gates(Stage.TRAINING, context)

# Check results
for result in results:
    print(f"Gate {result.gate_name}: {result.status.value}")
    if result.status != GateStatus.PASS:
        print(f"Recommendations: {result.recommendations}")
```
